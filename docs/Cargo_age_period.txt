Suggestion from John Franklin on Discord

A good suggestion is
120 - urban metro
160 - commuter train
200 - normal train
250 - express
400 - sleeper
and different types of luxuries. I don't know the situation of UK (although I will go there for study months later), but in China, we have hard seat, soft seat, hard sleeper, soft sleeper, sometimes luxury soft sleeper in conventional trains. In China Set: Trains, they are coded with such cargo decay factors:
Type                    0       1        2
Hard Seat               160     200     250
Soft Seat               192     240     300
Hard Sleeper            288     360     450
Soft Sleeper            384     480     600
Luxury Sleeper          640     800     1000

Where 0 stands for "no air conditioner nor restaurant car", 1 stands for "either", 2 stands for "Both".
