This document lists known breaking changes, which are changes which break savegame compatibility and may cause desync issues in multiplayer

When savegame-breaking changes are made, the minimum compatible version will be increased to the current version
(meaning the version will not automatically be used in older savegames)

Users who which to override this may do so, but will need to refer to the below list for information on the units that caused the breaking change
Sending any vehicles of the relevant unit to the depot and deleting it, then performing the update manually, should avoid broken units

Items marked with a + will break in a way which can be fixed after-the-fact by sending the unit to the depot
Items marked with a - may break in ways which mean they break in-place cannot be sent to the depot, and you would need to crash another unit into them to remove them
Items marked ? are unconfirmed or may have unknown/unexpected results

? Re-written build script may result in unexpected behaviour
