Anything labelled as "Re-drawn (new model)" or "New Unit"
should have most/all modern liveries, but I'm too lazy
to add them all individually


New build process based on MUTS

Added a passenger capacity multiplier parameter
.. So you can have huge games with a realistic number of trains
.. I got bored of needing 8 car Sprinters

Fixed various animation errors
Fixed various alignment errors
Fixed some introductory dates
