Anything labelled as "Re-drawn (new model)" or "New Unit"
should have most/all modern liveries, but I'm too lazy
to add them all individually

New build process based on MUTS

Added a passenger capacity multiplier parameter
.. So you can have huge games with a realistic number of trains
.. I got bored of needing 8 car Sprinters

Added a cost multiplier parameter, similar to the above. Allows for decreasing (1/2, 1/4) or increasing (2x, 4x) purchase cost and running cost

Fixed various animation errors
Fixed various alignment errors
Fixed some introductory dates
