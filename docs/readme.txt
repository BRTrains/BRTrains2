Modern UK Trainset
==================

1. About
========
This is a UK Train Set for OpenTTD including all the latest British Rail classes to be introduced between 2015 and 2025. This set is designed to be played with BRTrains (BRTrains lacks classes from after 2015, so this newGRF completes the gap) rather than on its own. Graphics are designed to work best with the Finescale UK Track Set, but will work with any track combination which provides 3rd rail tracks.

Features include the ability to swap liveries on units through the 'Refit' option, the ability to run trains at design speeds, and the dynamic raising/lowering of pantographs for bi-mode units.


2. Version Requirements
=======================

OpenTTD 1.10.0 or newer.
Modern UK Trainset doesn't support TTDPatch.


3. Parameters
=============

1) Max Speed:
    Actual Speed: The actual running speed of the trains on the UK network (nothing above 125mph).
    Design Speed: The maximum speed the trains have been designed to work under.
